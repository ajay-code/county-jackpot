Great news I will list all changes below:

Withdrawal Section:

Where it reads "Bank Account Details" could you change this to "Withdrawal Details" and also change "Update Bank Details" to "Update Withdrawal Details".

Could you also hide the withdrawal details that are displayed on the withdrawal section until the user selects "Update".

Could you please add a password requirement when choosing to update their withdrawal details.

When updating withdrawal details could you change where it reads "Edit Bank Account Details" to Update Withdrawal Details"

Under "Account Number" could you add a heading that reads "PayPal Email Address" for users to enter their paypal address.

And also underneath that could you add a heading that reads "Preferred Method of Withdrawal" and add a selection menu with the options "Withdraw to Bank" and "Withdraw to PayPal".

At the bottom of this page could you add the following text in bold: "Please note the chosen PayPal account must be in your name."

Profile Page:

Could you add a heading that reads "Opt out of email marketing?" and add tick box.

They are all of the changes I would like to make at the moment. If you could get back to me with a price I will go ahead and set up a second milestone.

Thanks
