Hi Pawandeep the contract should now be up and ready to go. I have contacted Brain Tree and am awaiting a response from them, hopefully I should get one by tomorrow in the mean time just go ahead and make a start on the other changes and I will get back to you as soon as I hear back off them.

Please find attached details of the necessary website changes that need to be made:


Fixes to the Delete User feature:

Currently when I try to delete a user from the system nothing actually happens and the users account remains in the system.

Changes to Memory Game:

Could you also change the amount of tiles to 9 and have them displayed in a 3x3 format across all platforms please.

Privacy Policy

I will also need to add and alter some text within the privacy policy but I am still writing this up at the moment so I will send you through a separate Word document in the next few days when I have completed it.

If you could make a start on these updates that would be great. As mentioned before I will get back to you hopefully no later than tomorrow with news about a Brain Tree account. If I am unable to apply for one then just go ahead and replace the stripe implementation with PayPal.

As always if you have any questions or need anything explaining in more detail just let me know.

Thanks and all the best
